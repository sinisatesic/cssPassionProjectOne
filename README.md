Buon giorno/pomeriggio/asera!

This is a brief description behind why I made this small project, and a short summary
about it. This project was my first time diving into CSS, and was created before I started
Codeup (full-stack web development). The project is intended to be playful and produce
a fun appeal. I called it "CSS Pourty" because that's exactly what comes to mind when I see it.
Regarding the actual code itself, it is extensive in CSS, and the naming convention I do need to
replace still since I gave certain classes arbitrary names like "blob", but this was before I started
learning about naming convention in coding and how important they are. What gives the project so much
activity is ample use of CSS animation keyframes; I used a plethora of them. 

This project was extremely fun to make, and I created it in about two days at a cafe in
San Antonio (Local Coffee off medical - nice coffee!). Below is a snippet of what the visual
characters appear as on the page:

Each character on the page moves via transform - translate 3d, and several of the 
"blobs" have blinking eyes and a few have moving mouths (translateX, translateY).
